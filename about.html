 <h5>We came together sharing the same passion...travel. We wanted to use this passion and our knowledge of different destinations across the world to help others curate their perfect trip and that's when we decided to found CFG:Travel!
We’d like to add more features to our site, such as longer questionaires and more third party advertiser links but we want to hear from you about what you want next before we make any changes. If you have any ideas, suggestions or questions please use our contact page to get in touch. As you can see, we are run by a small team, so you’ll always be able to find the person that you’ve been talking to.</h5>
